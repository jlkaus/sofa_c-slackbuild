sofa_c (IAU SOFA Astronomy C Library)

Official C implementations of the IAU algorithms for fundamental
astronomy computations.

Refer to https://www.iausofa.org/index.html for more details.

Note: By default, just installs the IAU SOFA C library and the included
documentation in /usr/share/doc.  If GEN_MAN_PAGES is defined in the
environment, attempts to convert the SOFA manual into proper man pages for each
function, and installs them in section 3.  A rough perl script to generate the
man pages is included, but may break with future SOFA releases if the manual.lis
file format changes too much.
